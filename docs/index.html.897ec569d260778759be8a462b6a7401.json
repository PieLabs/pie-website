It is designed to provide a full-stack solution to an existing problem. It provides tools for developing, packaging and rendering Assessment Items that use PIE interactions and elements. Interactions that are developed and packaged using the tools provided in this framework will render correctly - on any modern web system.</p>\n<p>We have great respect for the standards process and standards bodies in the education field. If at some time there is interest in making the format/API definitions used by this technology a standard we would welcome this. </p>\n<h5 id=\"caliper--tin-can--cmi5\"><a href=\"#caliper--tin-can--cmi5\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>Caliper / Tin Can / CMI5</h5>\n<p>PIE supports exporting activity events during the lifecycle of user interaction with PIEs. Support for IMS Caliper/ ADLnet Tin Can/CMI5 is possible using this model.</p>\n<h5 id=\"ims-lti\"><a href=\"#ims-lti\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>IMS LTI</h5>\n<p>PIE is just a system for rendering the interactions and questions, and as such can be wrapped in any page that may use an LTI Launch. Similarly, outcomes from user interaction could be returned through LTI outcomes.</p>\n<h5 id=\"ims-qti\"><a href=\"#ims-qti\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>IMS QTI</h5>\n<p>PIE Format does not replace QTI 2, but QTI items can be converted into PIE format and 'compiled' and as such can be distributed with the full visual rendering and behavior included. </p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-origin-of-pie\"><a href=\"#what-is-the-origin-of-pie\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>What is the Origin of PIE?</h3>\n<p>The PIE Framework is based on several years of work by CoreSpring.org in the field of building authoring and rendering tools for assessment interactions.</p>\n<p>We developed this technology to help fulfill our philanthropic mission of making high-quality, inexpensive &#x26; free assessment content available to educators.</p>\n<p>We believe this challenge of creating and sharing assessment items with advanced interactions with high-fidelity is shared across the education industry. </p>\n<p>We agree with the problem description and approach suggested by Smarter Balanced in the <a href=\"http://www.smarterapp.org/ARI/\">ARI</a> proposal and found that our existing technology was very compatible with delivering on this vision.</p>\n<p>We decided to make a new version of our solution to this problem available as an Open Source project in the hope that it will ultimately help educators have better access to high-quality and more interactive assessment interactions.</p>\n","__filename":"docs/index.md","__url":"/docs/","__resourceUrl":"/docs/index.html","__dataUrl":"/docs/index.html.897ec569d260778759be8a462b6a7401.json"}
