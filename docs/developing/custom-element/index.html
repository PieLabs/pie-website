For example if in the <code>env</code> property the <code>mode</code> was set to <code>evaluate</code> you would need the correct responses to a question available in your model so your Custom Element can display information about the responses. Or if the environment indicated that the current user had certain accessibility requirements, you can modify the model to support those.</p>\n<p>If no controller is provided by the pie definition, the <code>model</code> Promise will return: the <code>model</code> and <code>env</code> parameters that were passed in to it: <code>{model, env}</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"set-session\"><a href=\"#set-session\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a><code>set session</code></h4>\n<p>The session property represents the state of a user's interaction with the PIE.
