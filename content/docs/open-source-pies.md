# Open Source PIEs


## Pre-Release Status Note

The PIE Framework is currently in pre-release.

The current status is that we have ported all existing CoreSpring question types and tools to be compatible with the pie framework. We are in the process of updating the documentation for these elements to include them here. 


We will be publishing a catalog of these PIEs, and also welcome submissions for inclusion in this catalog.


## Example PIEs

These PIEs are reference examples of PIEs.


- [CoreSpring Choice - Single / Multi Choice Question Type](https://github.com/PieElements/corespring-choice)
- [CoreSpring Placement Ordering - Drag and Drop Ordering Question Type](https://github.com/PieElements/corespring-placement-ordering)
- [CoreSpring Matching](https://github.com/PieElements/corespring-match)
- [CoreSpring Number Line](https://github.com/PieElements/corespring-number-line)



>These are implemented using ES6 and the React Framework. CoreSpring will be gradually porting all or our question types to be implemented this way.
