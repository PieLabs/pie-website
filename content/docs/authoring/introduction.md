# PIE Authoring

> Status: Draft

Authoring depends on the `configure` components of a pie. These are optional packages that a pie developer can add to a pie definition. See [Configur](/docs/developing/configure) for more information.

>  The PIE cli `pie info` command will give a preview of the configure element if run from the foot of a pie item definition.

## Handling Image Uploads

Configure elements dispatch an event `'insert.image'`. See the [uploading](uploader.md) for more information.
